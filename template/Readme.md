# Template Design Pattern
This repository contains notes and examples for the Template Design Pattern. The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

The Template Design Pattern is useful when you have an algorithm that has a fixed structure but allows for some variation in its implementation. By defining the basic structure in a superclass, you can ensure that the algorithm is consistent across different implementations, while still allowing for customization where necessary.

## Contents
This repository contains the following files:

- notes.md: This file contains an overview of the Template Design Pattern, including its benefits and use cases.
- example.kt: This file contains an example implementation of the Template Design Pattern in Kotlin.
- LICENSE: This file contains the license for this repository.
## Usage
To use the Template Design Pattern in your own project, you can use the example implementation provided in example.kt as a starting point. Simply extend the abstract superclass and provide your own implementations for the abstract methods.
