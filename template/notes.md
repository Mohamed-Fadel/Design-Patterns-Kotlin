# Template Design Pattern Notes
The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the basic structure of an algorithm in a superclass, but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This pattern is useful when you have an algorithm that has a fixed structure but allows for some variation in its implementation.

## Benefits
The Template Design Pattern has several benefits, including:

- **Consistency**: By defining the basic structure of the algorithm in a superclass, you can ensure that the algorithm is consistent across different implementations.

- **Flexibility**: By allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm, you can customize the behavior of the algorithm where necessary.

- **Maintainability**: By separating the basic structure of the algorithm from its implementation details, you can make it easier to modify or extend the algorithm over time.

- **Testability**: By defining the algorithm in a modular and structured way, you can make it easier to test different parts of the algorithm in isolation.

# Use Cases
The Template Design Pattern is useful in a variety of situations, including:

- **Web frameworks**: Web frameworks often use the Template Design Pattern to define the basic structure of a web page or application, while allowing developers to customize specific parts of the page or application.

- **Data access layers**: Data access layers often use the Template Design Pattern to define the basic structure of data access operations, while allowing different implementations for different data sources.

- **Game development**: Game engines often use the Template Design Pattern to define the basic structure of a game loop, while allowing different implementations for different types of games.

# Example Implementation in Kotlin
Here is an example implementation of the Template Design Pattern in Kotlin:

```
abstract class Algorithm {
    fun execute() {
        stepOne()
        stepTwo()
        stepThree()
        stepFour()
    }

    abstract fun stepOne()
    abstract fun stepTwo()
    abstract fun stepThree()
    abstract fun stepFour()
}
```
```
class ConcreteAlgorithmOne : Algorithm() {
    override fun stepOne() {
        // Implementation for step one of Concrete Algorithm One
    }

    override fun stepTwo() {
        // Implementation for step two of Concrete Algorithm One
    }

    override fun stepThree() {
        // Implementation for step three of Concrete Algorithm One
    }

    override fun stepFour() {
        // Implementation for step four of Concrete Algorithm One
    }
}
```
```
class ConcreteAlgorithmTwo : Algorithm() {
    override fun stepOne() {
        // Implementation for step one of Concrete Algorithm Two
    }

    override fun stepTwo() {
        // Implementation for step two of Concrete Algorithm Two
    }

    override fun stepThree() {
        // Implementation for step three of Concrete Algorithm Two
    }

    override fun stepFour() {
        // Implementation for step four of Concrete Algorithm Two
    }
}
```

In this example, Algorithm is the abstract superclass that defines the basic structure of the algorithm, while ConcreteAlgorithmOne and ConcreteAlgorithmTwo are concrete subclasses that provide specific implementations for each step of the algorithm. 

To use this pattern, you would create an instance of one of the concrete subclasses and call its execute() method. The algorithm would then execute each step in the order defined by the superclass, but with the specific implementations provided by the subclass.
